# Creating supplemental figure 7 - New cell line performance with original model

To generate the sixth main figure of the manuscript, there are one step to follow:

1. [supp_figure_5.ipynb](./supp_figure_5.ipynb): Load in platemap, UMAP, PR curve accuracy results, and KS test results generate plots, and patch together to make one figure.

All steps can be ran with the bash script using the command below:

```bash
source supp_figure_5.sh
```
