# Creating supplemental figure 2 - Plate facet morphology differences at single-cell and well-population levels

To generate this supplemental figure of the manuscript, there is one step to follow:

1. [supp_figure_2.ipynb](./supp_figure_2.ipynb): Generate counts, UMAPs, and density plots that are facetted by plate, and patch the plots together to make one figure.

All steps can be ran with the bash script using the command below:

```bash
source supp_figure_3.sh
```
